In June and July 2015 a group of adults met to take part in a creative writing workshop held over two sessions, responding to the Treasured Possessions exhibition. Here is some of the writing that came out of those workshops inspired by objects within the show.

### The Original Treasure  

Patiently waiting under the sea  
Holding his breath for as long as can be  
The water crackling all around  
Shards of sunlight scraping the ground  
Poised and ready, spear in hand  
Bare feet floating above the sand  

Watching the rocks, body tense  
The world seeming as if in suspense  
Out of the corner of his eye  
Saw a nautilus swimming by  
Illuminated by the sky above  
It inspires respect and love  

Lingering on its beauty and history  
Its longevity and air of mystery  
He hardened his heart and closed his mind  
Humanity and conscience began to unwind  
Its status within his tribe no longer mattered  
His usual reverence fractured and shattered  

Instead of hunting fish to eat  
To feed his family, to make ends meet  
He could sell the shell and buy his food  
Enough for a month for his growing brood  
The lives of his people mean more  
Than some superstitious folklore  

It swam slowly, without a care  
Of the man it was unaware  
If seen, it would vanish into the endless blue  
At a speed he could never hope to do  
So, quick as a flash his hand reached out  
Before he began to have a doubt

Careful to avoid its tentacles and sharp beak  
He turned it upside down to make it weak  
Gradually returning to the surface with his prize  
He marvelled at its imposing size  
Yet this was smaller compared to those of old  
Its ancestors were ten times the size he'd been told  

Unchanged for millions of years  
It brought him almost to tears  
To take away its life  
With his crude handmade knife

Careful not to scratch its shell  
He gave a guttural yell  
And plunged his knife through its leathery hood  
A barricade it created, doing all it could  
To protect itself, to save its hide  
But least it was swift when it died  

Blue blood spurted into the sky  
And he realised he had taken something rare  
He returned to the shore  
And dug out the core  
Then prepared the shell  
As the tears fell  

Soon it was a thing of beauty  
And he had done his duty  
Bringing out the pearly shades  
Precious as Chinese jades  
He lifted it above his head  
Gave thanks and then said

"Thank you"  
But who to?  
He did not know  

Turning to go, a ray of sun caught its light  
Shone right through with all its might  
It was its last hurrah, a splendid sight  

That same day, the fisherman with regret  
Sold it to a merchant for all he could get  
Far less than its value, but worth much to him  
They engraved it with scenes from home on a whim  
It travelled across the sea to land  
On our continent on a market stand  

It reminded a travelling Englishman of China  
And he thought nothing could be finer  
It gave its life and he made it into a cup  
But it was never tarnished, never used to sup  
For fear of ruining the delicacy of its lustre  
Only for decoration it passed muster

Of the finest silver it was wrought  
Using skills that took years to be taught  
The Chinese engravings, skilled and unique  
The cup, a pale imitation, bold and yet meek  
Roman mythology combines with Chinese tradition  
In an uneasy marriage of convenience and sedition

For this item is made from two nations  
Captured by men of three stations  
A poor fisherman trying to survive  
A Chinese merchant starting to thrive  
And an English silversmith at their best  
But one part is better than all the rest:

The nautilus itself, the one that started it all  
Its quiet majesty holds everyone in its thrall

### Trophies

The rich man keeps the heads of animals he kills
in the room where he entertains company
with tales of the Orient
over fresh ice and stale awe.
He recalls the giraffe's eyelashes
how two stray ones landed like lovers
in the pool of hot blood
on the rock that impaled her neck
though he got her in the chest first.

The tumblers they drink from
make perfect water rings on the table.
They stand ominously
like the fire that frazzled the chimp
he had chased for three hours
only puncturing her left ankle.
He invites the guest to take a closer look
to spot the singed fur and to inhale the tang
whilst praising his taxidermist's detailing
even with the messiest kills.

He fetches the decanter from the cabinet
eclipsed by the open-mouthed tiger
reflections of candle light convulsing along her teeth.
The guest sits with rounded shoulders
as the rich man remembers
how he enraged the biggest tigress in all India
by gunning down her cub
as he chased a dragonfly.
Her irises swelled from the dust storm
that swarmed her sprinting body
he waited until he felt the heat from her nostrils
before he pulled the trigger.

When the rich man dies he will keep his head.
She will remember him
the only way she knows how
submerging him in molten wax
where the liquid will kiss him hard
leaving ashy bruises everywhere
but that won't matter
she will add brows and lashes.
He will be framed and kept in the room
with the heads of animals he killed.

### In Memory Of Curved Heels

You may look but do not touch.  
Encased in their glass coffin  
as if in Cinderella's carriage.  
Stationary. No longer fit for purpose.

Numbed by her nimbleness,  
calluses unseen,  
golden capillaries of toil;  
those vein-like threads now jaundiced with age.

Embroidered memories of corseted toes.  
Those folded ribbons of vanity.  
Fashion over function.  
'Me lady' with her bespoke two left shoes.

Arthritic feet dream of wearing made-to-measure,  
abandoning Velcro slippers  
extra-wide and functional  
with easy access at Christmas.

No accolade from  
Louboutin, Blahnik or Choo.  
Your style goes unnoticed,  
footprints unseen.

So rejoice and buy your replica keepsake,  
that mass produced lookalike treasure;  
such hope of reliving tottered pasts.  
Who says 'Thou shalt not covet?'

### Les Indispensibles

Serpentine cords draw us together  
Intricate rose pattern designed and worked by me  
Never used by me.

A "reticule" for la Madame du Jour  
Holds handkerchief, fan and money for cards  
Never to be seen without one.

A "ridicule" to match fine robes  
No space in that finery for pockets like mine  
Never to be seen together.

Unforgiving ebony mould  
Worked on in failing candlelight  
Never to be finished by me.

Serpentine strings pull us apart  
Fine design started but abandoned by me  
Never to be seen again.

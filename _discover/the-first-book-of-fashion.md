Professor Ulinka Rublack, Professor of Early Modern European History at the University of Cambridge, has been investigating the history of Matth√§us Schwarz, a 16th Century accountant in the German city of Augsburg.

Schwarz was one of the most committed fashion innovators of his time. Between 1520 and 1560 Schwarz commissioned 137 astonishingly detailed images of himself wearing innovative dress. Across the world this has become noted as The First Book of Fashion and the fullest account of what any Renaissance man wore.

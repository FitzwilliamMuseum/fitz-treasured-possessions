{% include structure/image.html %}

Italian, Murano (Venice), late 16th/early 17th century.
Clear glass (cristallo) with moulded bowl and hollow wythern stem.

This tazza was designed for red wine. However, its shallow bowl with undulating rim meant that great skill was required in order to drink from it without spillage. It may also have been used to serve sweetmeats, such as sugared and spiced fruits.

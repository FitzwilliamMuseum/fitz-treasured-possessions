Coffee pot
English, Staffordshire, c.1763–70.

Staffordshire red stoneware was highly fashionable for tea-, coffee- and chocolate-wares between c.1750 and 1775. It recalled ‘Porcelain Rouge’, the luxury unglazed red stoneware made in Yixing, China, which had been exported to Europe from the seventeenth century. The form of this coffee pot derives from more expensive examples in silver. It is decorated with contemporary political imagery as well as Chinese-inspired motifs.

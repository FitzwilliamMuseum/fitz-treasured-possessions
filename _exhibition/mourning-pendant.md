English, 1790.
Rose gold, with an enamel and gilt-metal

‘SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF AN ADOPTED CHILD’ are the words inscribed around the edge of this rose-gold fluted pendant. In the centre is an urn, and beneath it the initials of the child and the date of death: ‘T.G’ died in 1790. A closer look reveals that the urn is mounted on a background woven with locks of the child’s brassy hair. Suspended on a chain and hanging near the heart, this pendant served as a material reminder of a child loved and lost.

S.G. Perceval Bequest, 1922

Cat. no. 245

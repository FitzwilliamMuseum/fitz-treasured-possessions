Thomas Townley, London, c.1685.
Silver, cutlery with detachable handles.

Nestling within a once-lockable case, made from shagreen (shark or ray hide), is a silver beaker, inside which fits a removable holder with slots for a small silver spice box and a silver knife, fork and spoon â€“ everything necessary to ensure refined and sanitary food consumption when travelling. The cutlery has detachable handles to make it as compact as possible. The green velvet adds luxury but also provides padding to protect the delicately engraved dining implements.

Lent by Jonathan Gray from the Bill Gray Collection

Cat. no. 55

German, Nuremberg, c.1520–30. possibly after a drawing by Hans Schwarz (1492–after 1521).

Probably from Nuremberg, this small honestone portrait relief shows an unknown woman embracing the fashions of Renaissance Germany. She is portrayed without a hood or veil, her plaited hair on full view, and wearing a beret – a piece of headwear originally designed for men. Fashion gave women the opportunity to shape their identities, experiment with gender roles and create new versions of feminine virtue and beauty.

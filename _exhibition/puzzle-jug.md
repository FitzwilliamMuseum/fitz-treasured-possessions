{% include structure/image.html %}

English, probably London (either Lambeth Pottery or Rotherhithe Pottery), 1686.
Tin-glazed earthenware, with pierced body containing a two-headed bird.

Puzzle jugs provided entertainment across early modern Europe with players attempting to drink the jugâ€™s contents (normally wine or ale) without spilling any from its many holes and spouts. This English delftware jug is trickier than others. To gain suction, a secret hole under the handle must be covered with a finger. Though usually owned by inns and taverns, this jug is personalized with the initials of a couple (P over N and M) and the date 1686, and may commemorate their marriage.
